## ABOUT ME
Hi! I'm Saffa Nailah Zafirah, S.Si, a naturally curious data enthusiast with a degree in Geography from Universitas Indonesia (2024). My first exposure to data came through working with spatial data using GIS tools like ArcMap, where I explored patterns tied to location and space.

After graduation, I discovered a deeper interest in turning raw data into insights that drive real-world decisions. That realization led me to expand my skill set beyond spatial data — focusing on SQL, Excel, and Power BI to extract insights, solve problems, and communicate findings with clarity.

With a growing passion for data exploration and knowledge-building, I’m committed to continuously evolving my skills and contributing to meaningful, data-informed solutions.
